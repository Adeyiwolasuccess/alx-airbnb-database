# Monitor and Refine Database Performance â€“ Airbnb Database

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and applying schema adjustments such as indexes and query refactoring.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Monitored Queries
We chose five representative, high-frequency queries for profiling:

1. **Login lookup (User by email)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, password_hash
   FROM `User`
   WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';
Userâ€™s bookings (recent first)

sql
Copy code
SELECT booking_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status, created_at
FROM Booking
WHERE user_id = 'USER-UUID-123'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
Property availability check

sql
Copy code
SELECT booking_id
FROM Booking
WHERE property_id = 'PROP-UUID-123'
  AND start_date <= '2025-12-20'
  AND end_date   >= '2025-12-15';
Complex join: bookings + user + property + payment

sql
Copy code
SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       p.name AS property_name, p.location,
       pay.amount, pay.payment_method, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN `User` u      ON u.user_id     = b.user_id
JOIN Property p    ON p.property_id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON pay.booking_id = b.booking_id
ORDER BY b.booking_id ASC
LIMIT 200;
Ranking properties by bookings (window function)

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.property_id, p.name AS property_name,
       COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS property_rank
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON b.property_id = p.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC
LIMIT 50;
ðŸ§ª Methodology
Used EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to observe execution plans and timing.

Compared performance before and after applying optimizations.

Key checks included:

type column (ALL â†’ bad; ref/eq_ref â†’ good)

rows estimated vs actual

key chosen (shows which index is used)

Presence of Using filesort or Using temporary (performance red flags)

ðŸ›  Refinements Applied
Added indexes to common filter/sort columns:

User(email), User(role), User(created_at)

Booking(user_id, created_at), Booking(property_id, start_date, end_date)

Property(location), Property(pricepernight)

Payment(booking_id)

Refactored complex join to select only necessary columns instead of SELECT *.

Ordered queries on indexed columns (e.g., ORDER BY booking_id).

Partitioning on Booking(start_date) (from Task 5) further helped range queries.

ðŸ“ˆ Results (Sample)
Query	Before (ms)	After (ms)	Improvement
Login lookup	120	3	~97% faster
Userâ€™s bookings recent	150	7	~95% faster
Property availability	250	12	~95% faster
Complex join	280	30	~89% faster
Ranking properties	210	120	~43% faster

(Replace with your actual timings from EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

âœ… Key Takeaways
Always monitor with EXPLAIN ANALYZE before and after changes.

Composite indexes tailored to queries (e.g., (user_id, created_at)) give huge speedups.

Avoid SELECT * in production queries.

Partitioning + indexing = scalable performance for large datasets.

Performance refinement is continuous: keep profiling as data grows.
